<p>Welcome to my new homepage. It is currently under construction, I am adding to it daily! Here you will find important links and information such as my LinkedIn, resume, current projects, relevant coursework, and much more! </p>
<p>I am currently an incoming graduate student to the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">University of California, Santa Cruz</a> in the Scientific Computing & Applied Mathematics MS Program with an expected graduation of June 2018.
   I recently graduated from the <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu">University of California, Davis</a> with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical & Scientific Computation and a Statistics minor in June 2015.
   I also graduated with highest honors and an IB Diploma from my high school, <a href="http://www.guajome.net">Guajome Park Academy</a> in 2011.</p>

<h3>
  <a id="intern" class="anchor" href="#intern" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="intern-link"></span></a>Internships.</h3>
  <p>I am currently in heavy search of internships year-round. My goal is to stay busy as a graduate student: focusing not only on coursework but also getting my feet wet with academic research and industry internships relevant to my studies.</p>
